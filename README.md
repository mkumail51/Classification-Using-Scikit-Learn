# **Overview**

This repository demonstrates how to implement and evaluate multiple classification models using Python's scikit-learn library. It showcases best practices for splitting your data, generating predictions on unseen data, and comparing model performance using the accuracy score.
This project implements several classification models on a common dataset. Each model is trained on a training set and evaluated on a separate test set. In this repository, we include:
### Logistic Regression Classifier:
A baseline linear model.
### Decision Tree Classifier:
A non-linear model that makes decisions by splitting data based on feature thresholds.
### **Random Forest Classifier:** 
An ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions.
### **Gradient Boosting Classifier:** 
An ensemble method that builds models sequentially, where each model attempts to correct the errors of its predecessor.

## Features
### Multiple Model Implementations: 
Easily compare different classification approaches.
### Consistent Evaluation Methodology:
Each model is evaluated using a separate test set where x_test is used to generate predictions and y_test provides the true labels.
### Extensible Codebase:
Designed to allow additional models or evaluation metrics with minimal modifications.

## **Prerequisites:**
  - Python 3.6 or higher
  - scikit-learn
  - numpy
  - pandas


## **Code Explanation**
For each model, the repository follows a consistent evaluation process:

## Prediction:
The model generates predictions using x_test (the test set features).
## Evaluation:
The predictions are compared with the true labels in y_test using accuracy_score.

## **Models Used**
### 1. Logistic Regression Classifier
A simple yet effective linear model used as a baseline for classification tasks.

### 2. Decision Tree Classifier
A non-linear model that splits the dataset into branches based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure for decision making.

### 3. Random Forest Classifier
An ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

### 4. Gradient Boosting Classifier
An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting errors made by the previous ones.
